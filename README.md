# COLLEGE-ADMINISTRATION-SYSTEM----MySQL
Designed and developed a normalized MySQL database to manage students, faculty, courses, attendance, and fees with proper keys and relationships ensuring data integrity. Implemented SQL operations, JOINs, subqueries, views, and aggregates to analyze class strength, fee status, academic performance, and faculty workload efficiently.


This project was developed to simulate the design and implementation of a comprehensive database management system for a college environment. It incorporates core SQL concepts and functionalities, including database creation, table design, normalization, and relationship management to ensure structured and efficient data storage. The system is designed to manage key academic and administrative entities such as students, faculty, courses, attendance, and fee records, reflecting real-world institutional requirements.

The project was implemented using MySQL as the primary database language, with MySQL Workbench serving as the development environment for database design, query execution, and schema visualization. It demonstrates practical knowledge of SQL operations, relational database principles, and data integrity, providing hands-on experience in building scalable and maintainable database systems.
